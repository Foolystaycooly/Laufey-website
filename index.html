This view used to bring
A smile to my face
Lately it's done nothing but
Remind me of the way

The way that you used to
Give me butterflies
Took me 21 days to
Walk our former paradise
Paradise, bu-bu-bu-day duh

Step by step, brick by brick
I'm reclaiming what's mine
This city is way too small
To give away to just one guy

Street by street, breath by breath
From the Back Bay to the sky
I'm taking back my city
I'm taking back my life

The cafÃ©
Where you asked me for my name
The bookstore we spent
Five hours hiding from the rain

It's like a game of Monopoly
Except I steal back all my property
And leave you on the ground
And I know that I'll see you one day on the street
With a girl on your arm but I won't let that keep me from this town

From this town
From this town, oh

Step by step, brick by brick
I'm reclaiming what's mine
This city is way too small
To give away to just one guy

Street by street, breath by breath
From the Back Bay to the sky
I'm taking back my city
I'm taking back my life
I'm taking back my city">Street by Street</li>

Magnolia
She could have anyone in the world
Floats around town in a golden gown
Born in a castle on a cloud

Magnolia
Prettiest girl that I know
Stars in her eyes
Handpicked from the skies
Beautiful soul

How can I compete with her?
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia

Magnolia
She can move oceans and rivers with ease
A word from her lips
Her sirens kiss
Will send you straight into abyss

Magnolia
I wish she'd give her secrets away
Enchants everyone
And I think it'd be fun
To be like her someday

But I cannot compete with her
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia

    <li data-lyrics="
Maybe one day I'll fall in a bookstore
Into the arms of a guy
We'll sneak into bars
And gaze at the stars
Surrounded by fireflies

Oh, I'd like to sleep in 'til two on a Sunday
And listen to the bluebirds sigh
Get soaked in the rain
And smile through the pain
Slow dance under stormy skies

Maybe I'm just old-fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck
No one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love

And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So, with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So, with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love, love, love" data-audio="assets/audio/I Wish You Love - laufey - SoundLoadMate.com.mp3">I Wish You Love</li>
